      What is typography?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Typography is a way of arranging type to make text legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.
      Angular Material's theming system supports customizing the typography settings for the library's components.
      Additionally, Angular Material provides APIs for applying typography styles to elements in your own application.

    <h4>
      Including font assets
    </h4>
    <p>
      Angular Material's typography APIs lets you specify any font-face. The default font-face value is configured
      to Google's Roboto font with the 300, 400, and 500 font-weight styles. To use Roboto, your application must
      load the font, which is not included with Angular Material. The easiest way to load Roboto, or any other
      custom font, is by using Google Fonts. The following snippet can be placed in your application's
      to load Roboto from Google Fonts.
